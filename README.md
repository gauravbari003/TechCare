1. Introduction
TechCare is an innovative console-based platform developed to streamline the management of hardware and software support within an organization. Designed using Java, MySQL, JDBC, and Spring Tool Suite (Eclipse), TechCare enables employees to report technical issues efficiently, allows engineers to manage and resolve these issues, and provides oversight to the Head of Department (HOD). This system ensures that technical problems are addressed promptly, minimizing downtime and enhancing productivity.
Importance of IT Support Systems: In today’s digital era, organizations rely heavily on IT infrastructure. Any downtime or malfunction can severely impact business operations. TechCare addresses this by providing a structured and efficient support system, ensuring that hardware and software issues are managed effectively.
Summary of Features:
•	HOD: Manage engineers and oversee problem resolution.
•	Engineers: Address assigned problems and update their status.
•	Employees: Report issues and track their resolution status.
2. Objectives
Goals of TechCare:
•	Provide a 24/7 accessible platform for reporting and managing IT issues.
•	Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of technical support within an organization.
•	Minimize downtime caused by hardware and software problems.
Key Problems Addressed:
•	Lack of a centralized system for reporting and tracking technical issues.
•	Inefficient assignment and resolution of problems.
•	Difficulty in monitoring the status and history of reported issues.
Expected Benefits:
•	Streamlined process for reporting and managing IT issues.
•	Improved accountability and transparency in problem resolution.
•	Enhanced productivity due to reduced downtime.
3. System Analysis
Problem Definition
Employees frequently encounter hardware and software issues that disrupt their workflow. These problems often lead to significant downtime, affecting productivity and business operations. Without a centralized system, reporting and managing these issues become chaotic, with no clear oversight or accountability.
Preliminary Investigation
To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary investigation:
•	Data Gathering: Collected data on the frequency and types of IT issues reported.
•	Interviews: Conducted interviews with employees, engineers, and HODs to understand their pain points.
•	Benchmarking: Analyzed existing support systems and their shortcomings.
Feasibility Study
Technical Feasibility:
•	Java, MySQL, and JDBC: Well-supported technologies suitable for developing a robust console-based system.
•	Spring Tool Suite (Eclipse): Provides a comprehensive environment for Java development.
Economic Feasibility:
•	Minimal costs involved as the project utilizes open-source technologies and existing infrastructure.
•	Potential for significant cost savings through reduced downtime and improved efficiency.
Operational Feasibility:
•	The system can be easily integrated into the existing workflow.
•	User-friendly interface ensures quick adoption by employees, engineers, and HODs.

4. Scope Identified
User Roles and Responsibilities:
•	HOD: Register and manage engineers, oversee all reported problems, and assign issues to engineers.
•	Engineers: View and resolve assigned problems, update their status, and manage their account.
•	Employees: Register and track hardware/software issues, view problem status, and manage their account.
System Boundaries:
•	Only registered users (HOD, engineers, employees) can access the system.
•	The system handles problem reporting and resolution for hardware and software issues within the organization.
Limitations:
•	The system is currently console-based, which may limit its usability compared to a graphical interface.
•	It is designed for internal use within the organization and does not support external user access.
5. Features
HOD Features:
•	Login: Secure access using predefined credentials.
•	Engineer Management: Register new engineers with specific roles (hardware/software), view all engineers, and delete engineers.
•	Problem Oversight: View all reported problems and assign them to appropriate engineers.
Engineer Features:
•	Login: Access using credentials provided by the HOD.
•	Problem Management: View and update the status of assigned problems, and maintain a record of addressed issues.
•	Account Management: Change password to ensure secure access.
Employee Features:
•	Self-Registration: Create an account with a username and password.
•	Problem Reporting: Report hardware/software issues and generate a unique complaint ID.
•	Status Tracking: Check the status of reported issues and view the assigned engineer.
•	Complaint History: View a complete history of all complaints raised.
•	Password Management: Change password for secure access.
